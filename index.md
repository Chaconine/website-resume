## Resume

### Career Objective

An engineer interested in making concise, accessible, and intuitive data visualizations for better reasoning complex relationships between data.

### Projects

1. [3D computer vision tracking with the Microsoft Kinect](https://github.com/Chaconine/Depth-tracking)


- Developed 3D visualizer and tested unsupervised methods for understanding social behaviors

2. [Static website design for Taga Lab at Berkeley](https://chaconine.github.io/research.html)
- Written from scratch, hosted on github.op

3. Visualizations in D3.js

4. Training graph neural networks 
- Non-Euclidean relationships between data, (i.e. social graphs, citation networks) require unique approaches to embedding data so they can be visualized 

### Current Working On

1. Math with manim, initially developed by 3b1b
2. Rome-wasnt-built-in-a-day, a visual 3d voxel bridge builder that uses reinforcement learning policies to build bridges of varying complexity
3. Elementary Differential Geometry, Math 423 at UIUC, inspired parametric curve tracing on unit sphere in D3.js

### Education
**UC Berkeley**
Bachelor of Science in Microbial Biology
GPA 3.71/4
