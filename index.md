## Resume

### Career Objective

An engineer interested in making concise, accessible, and intuitive data visualizations for better reasoning complex relationships between data.

### Projects

1. [3D computer vision tracking with the Microsoft Kinect](https://github.com/Chaconine/Depth-tracking)

![Testing](https://youtu.be/pSL2Q0v8fgA)

- Developed 3D visualizer for Python with package pptk that renders 2 million points

![More Testing](https://youtu.be/dnkyyjuUDek)
- Tested unsupervised methods for understanding social behaviors

2. [Static website design for Taga Lab at Berkeley](https://chaconine.github.io/research.html)
- Written from scratch, hosted on github.op

3. Visualizations in D3.js

4. Training graph neural networks 
- Non-Euclidean relationships between data, (i.e. social graphs, citation networks) require unique approaches to embedding data so they can be visualized 

### Hobbies

1. Math with manim, initially developed by 3b1b
