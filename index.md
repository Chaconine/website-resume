- Developed 3D visualizer for Python with package pptk that renders 2 million points

[![Color visualizer](assets/color.webp)](https://youtu.be/dnkyyjuUDek)
- Tested unsupervised methods for understanding social behaviors

2. [Static website design for Taga Lab at Berkeley](https://chaconine.github.io/research.html)
- Written from scratch, hosted on github pages

3. Visualizations in D3.js

4. Training graph neural networks 
- Non-Euclidean relationships between data, (i.e. social graphs, citation networks) require unique approaches to embedding data so they can be visualized 

### Hobbies

1. Math with manim, initially developed by 3b1b
