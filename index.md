### Projects

- Visualizations in D3.js

<script src="js/chart.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

- [Prototyped website design for Taga Lab at Berkeley](https://chaconine.github.io/research.html)
    - HTML/CSS available in [github repo](https://github.com/Chaconine/TagaLabWebsite)
    - Hosted on Github Pages

- [3D computer vision tracking with the Microsoft Kinect](https://github.com/Chaconine/Depth-tracking)
    - Developed 3D visualizer for Python with package pptk that renders 2 million points from the Microsoft Kinect
    - Tested unsupervised methods for understanding social behaviors
    - Worked on various models for inferring 3d kinematics from 2d images

- Training graph neural networks 
    - Non-Euclidean relationships between data, (i.e. social graphs, citation networks) require unique approaches to embedding data so they can be visualized 
    - Working through Stanford's CS224w, focused primarily on various implementations and architectures of graph neural nets in PyTorch

### Hobbies

- Animating math with manim, initial package developed by 3b1b

- Rome-wasnt-built-in-a-day, a visual 3d voxel bridge builder that uses reinforcement learning policies to build bridges of varying complexity, working with Lyric Doshi (in progress)

- [Elementary Differential Geometry](https://netmath.illinois.edu/college/math-423), Math 423 at UIUC, inspired parametric curve tracing on unit sphere in D3.js

- [Blogging about neuroscience](https://sonichedgehogs.com/)
