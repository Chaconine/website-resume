2. [Static website design for Taga Lab at Berkeley](https://chaconine.github.io/research.html)
- Written from scratch, hosted on github pages

3. Visualizations in D3.js

4. Training graph neural networks 
- Non-Euclidean relationships between data, (i.e. social graphs, citation networks) require unique approaches to embedding data so they can be visualized 

### Hobbies

1. Math with manim, initially developed by 3b1b

2. Rome-wasnt-built-in-a-day, a visual 3d voxel bridge builder that uses reinforcement learning policies to build bridges of varying complexity, working with Lyric Doshi (in progress)

3. [Elementary Differential Geometry](https://netmath.illinois.edu/college/math-423), Math 423 at UIUC, inspired parametric curve tracing on unit sphere in D3.js

4. [Blogging about neuroscience](https://sonichedgehogs.com/)
